# AKM320 notes

The **AKM320** is a cheap 32-key midi controller that can be found for sale under several different badgings and brands (mine was branded as the miditech's i2-mini 32). This document contains some notes I've made regarding its hardware as part of a project to turn an unusued and partially broken keyboard into a custom stand-alone synth.

For clarity I'll refer to the original microcontroller logic of the AKM320 as the "Vanilla Controller" in this document.
  
## Keyboard Matrix

The keyboard matrix is connected to the main board through (what I believe is) a 16-pin 1.0mm fpc cable.

The following is the key matrix of the keyboard, a <insert resistance> diode is placed on each individual switch in the direction shown by the arrow.

Each key on the keyboard has 2 outputs (labeled here as *plus* and *minus*), *plus* is activated when the key is mostly pressed while *minus* is activated when the key is partially pressed. The vanilla controller uses the difference in timing between the activation of these 2 signals to determine how fast (the velocity) the key was pressed. 

Alternative uses for the *minus*/*plus* signals could include:

* Customized velocity midi curves (not possible with vanilla controller)
* Key-off velocity (this is part of the midi-spec but rarely supported, including by the vanilla controller.
* A crude form of before/aftertouch 
* Timbre control
* Non-sensitive mode, ignoring one of the signals to save I/O pins.
